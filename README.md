# CSIT-111-Java-Assignment-lab-2
In this lab assignment we were asked to complete three java programs called Dice, Distance, and Wrapper. In Dice.java I created a java program that simulates the rolling of a pair of dice. For each die in the pair, the program generates a random number between 1 and 6 inclusive. It prints out the result of the roll for each die and the sum of the two dice. The distance.java is constructed to compute the distance between two points which would be entered in by the user. The last program called Wrapper.java uses the constants and methods of the Integer class.
